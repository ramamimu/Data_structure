- **Root** - First and top node on a tree.
- **Edge** - Reference that connects two node together. 
- **Child** - Extension (node from underneath) from a node
- **Parent** - Node that is above another node. Every node has a parent excluding the root node. 
- **Siblings** - set of two nodes or more with the same parent.
- **Leaf** - node that does not have a child. 
- **Internal node** - all nodes that **are not a leaf** and **root**.
